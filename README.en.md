## Project Motivation
The open-sourcing of Deepseek inspired me to reflect: as an individual developer, how could I contribute to the industry in my own way? I‚Äôve always been passionate about the convergence of "AI + IoT," particularly the potential of edge computing. To address potential cross-platform interaction needs in the future, I decided to learn a new technology stack. Between TypeScript and Flutter, I chose the less mainstream but more natively performant Flutter. Over the past month, I‚Äôve been learning the framework while building the foundational architecture. Moving forward, I plan to focus on two goals: creating reusable component libraries and exploring lightweight edge computing implementations. Through this open-source project, I hope to collaborate with the community to explore possibilities in the AIoT era.


## üöÄ Current Status
**Early Development Phase** (v0.1-alpha)  
‚ö†Ô∏è Not yet usable - Actively under development
- The goal is to implement basic interaction functionalities within the next 1-2 weeks.
- Current features are unstable, especially as storage formats are highly likely to change. The project is not yet ready for practical use.

## ‚ú® Core Features
### 1. AI Agent Manager
- Flexible agent lifecycle management
- Cross-device synchronization
- Plugin system architecture

### 2. Markdown-based Conversation
- Native markdown conversation storage
- Version-controlled dialogue history
- Portable conversation format

### 3. Modular Design
- Independent functional components
- Hot-swappable feature modules
- Decoupled architecture
